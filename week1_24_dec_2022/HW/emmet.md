1.  Emmet (https://emmet.io/) is a plugin for text editors that help developers in writing HTML, CSS boilerplate code. This plugin is enabled in VSCode by default and helps in the process of development.
1.  When CSS-like expressions are written, a corresponding snippet of code is added to the HTML file accordingly.
1.  It is greatly helpful in writing CSS code. (For eg: When p10 is typed in a CSS file in VSCode, padding: 10px is automatically added to the file, greatly reducing the time taken in the development)
1.  Custom Emmet abbreviations are possible too. Creating a snippets.json with the custom expansion of the tags will help to create custom boiletplate code.
