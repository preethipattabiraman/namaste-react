#### Comments can be written in the same way as it is written in JS. Note that, JS can be included in JSX by introducing a set of curly braces.

function App() {
    return (
        {
            /**
            * I am a JS multi-line comment
            *
            */
            //And I am a single-line comment!
        }
    )

}
