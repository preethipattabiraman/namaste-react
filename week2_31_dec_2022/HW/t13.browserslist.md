1. Browserslist is a tool that helps to specify which browsers should support the front-end application that is developed.
2. Used primarily for the newly created JS frameworks and libraries like React.
3. This list of browsers can be specified in package.json with a transpiler - Babel which will help the bundler like Parcel to create different bundlers for different browsers.
4. Babel will create a larger bundle for the older browsers - because the ES6 features are not supported by all the browsers. Polyfills are added to make it compatible with older browsers.
5. For the modern browsers, a smaller bundle with minification, compression done is created.
