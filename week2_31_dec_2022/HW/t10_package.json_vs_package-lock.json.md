1. As the name suggests, package-lock.json locks the version of the dependency.
2. This is automatically created when NPM modifies the node_modules tree or package.json file. 
3. This is to ensure that there are no differences in the dependencies installed in different environments.
4. package.json is used for storing the metadata of the project.
5. Never modify the package-lock.json since it locks the proper dependencies with their versions with which the application works the same way in all the environments.

## ^ vs ~
A version has three parts : major.minor.patch
1. ~ : Match the most recent patch version (bug fixes). (1.1.x updates)
2. ^ : Match the most recent minor and patch versions (backward-compatible versions - default notation of NPM). (1.x.x updates)

## integrity
1. This is a standard subresource integrity of the package/resource
2. This is indicate whether the resource has been delivered without unexpected manipulation.
