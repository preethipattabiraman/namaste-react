1. When a package is installed using the npm install command, a corresponding folder is created named, node_modules into which installed packages are copied here.
2. It can be thought as a cache to the packages that are installed in the project.
3. These need not be checked in to the repository since - node_modules is heavy and this folder can be recreated with basic commands on the server if needed.
4. This happens because the exact version of the packages using which the project works is locked in package-lock.json. It will take care of the details.
